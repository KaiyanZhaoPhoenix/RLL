"""
Energy-Based Prioritized DQN (EBP-DQN) for Atari environments.

This implementation combines:
1. DQN (Deep Q-Network)
2. Energy-Based Prioritization
3. Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
4. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)

Key Components:
- EnergyBasedPrioritizedBuffer: Implements energy-based prioritized experience replay
- EBPDQN: Extends DQN with energy-based prioritization
- SegmentTree: Efficient segment tree data structure for prioritized sampling
